## Development

### Frontend (React + Vite.js)

For frontend development, we use React with Vite.js. The source files are located in the `resources/js` directory.

To start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Backend (Laravel)

Backend files are in the standard Laravel structure. APIs and routes are defined in the `routes` directory.

To start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

## Build

To build the production-ready assets, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized and minified assets in the `public` directory.
